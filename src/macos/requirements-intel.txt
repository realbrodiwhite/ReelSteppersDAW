# Qt 6.2 is the end of the road for us on Intel Mac because
# the build machine for Intel Mac is stuck on Catalina, and
# the next LTS (6.5) created a requirement for Big Sur or
# above.  We may consider getting another Intel Mac if this
# becomes a problem later, but the intention is not to do that
